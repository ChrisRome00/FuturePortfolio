    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p> <blockquote> My name is Christopher Romero and I am starting my FullStack Web Development journey
        on this day (June 28th, 2023). This is a learning sample to showcase what I have learned 
        so far on this exciting path. I am of the first in my generation to step into this field
        of tech based working, therefore it has been a fairly lonely path to not even be surrounded by those who do.
        Hopefully by the end of this course I am taking (6 months) I will have the ability to create 
        something more. I have little to no work experience and hope that this career will take me 
        places I have never dreamed of. Again this is a future resume I want to have!</blockquote>
