    <blockquote> In my free time I am currently learning web development apart from getting my degree in software 
    development. Apart from learning it, I like to spend my free time playing FPS shooters, MOBA's,
    and open world video games. Watching movies and TV are probably the only thing I do when I feel
    burnt out but that hasnt happened lately, thank god. </blockquote>
